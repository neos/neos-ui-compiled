CkEditorFormattingRulesRegistry(`\n        Contains the possible styles for CKeditor.\n\n        ## Enabled Styles\n\n        The actual *enabled* styles are determined by the NodeTypes configuration of the property.\n        This means, that if the node is configured using NodeTypes\n        \\`properties.[propertyName].ui.aloha.formatting.strong=true\\`, then the \"strong\" key inside this registry\n        is actually enabled for the editor.\n\n        For backwards compatibility reasons, the formatting-and-styling-registry *KEYS* must match the \"pre-React\"\n        UI, if they existed beforehand.\n\n\n        ## Configuration of CKeditor\n\n        With this config, CKeditor itself is controlled:\n        - the Advanced Content Filter (ACF) is configured, thus which markup is allowed in the editors\n        - which effect a button action actually has.\n\n        Currently, there exist three possible effects:\n        - *triggering a command*\n        - *setting a style*\n        - *executing arbitrary code*\n\n\n        ## Configuration Format:\n\n        NOTE: one of \"command\" or \"style\" must be specified in all cases.\n\n        - \\`command\\` (string, optional). If specified, this CKEditor command is triggered; so the command string\n          is known by CKeditor in the \"commands\" section:\n          http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/api/CKEDITOR.editor-method-getCommand\n\n        - \\`style\\` (object, optional). If specified, this CKEditor style is applied. Expects a style description\n          adhering to CKEDITOR.style(...), so for example: \\`{ style: {element: 'h1'}\\`\n\n        - \\`config\\` (function, optional): This function needs to adjust the CKEditor config to e.g. configure ACF\n          correctly. The function gets passed in the config so-far, and needs to return the modified config. See\n          \"CKEditor Configuration Helpers\" below for helper functions.\n\n        ## CKEditor Configuration Helpers\n\n        - \\`config: registry.ckEditor.formattingRules.config.addToFormatTags('h1')\\`: adds the passed-in tag to the\n          \\`format_tags\\` configuration option of CKEditor.\n\n        - \\`registry.ckEditor.formattingRules.config.add('Strong')\\`: adds the passed-in *Button Definition Name*\n          to the ACF configuration (automatic mode).

Wiring\n\n        Every component gets the following properties (see EditorEnvelope/index.js)\n\n        - identifier: an identifier which can be used for HTML ID generation\n        - label: the label\n        - node: the current node\n        - value: The value to display\n        - propertyName: Name of the property to edit (of the node)\n        - options: additional editor options\n        - commit: a callback function when the content changes.\n          - 1st argument: the new value\n          - 2nd argument (optional): an object whose keys are to-be-triggered *saveHooks*, and the values\n            are hook-specific options.\n            Example: {'Neos.UI:Hook.BeforeSave.CreateImageVariant': nextImage}\n        - renderSecondaryInspector(inspectorIdentifier, secondaryInspectorComponentFactory):\n          - 1st argument: a string identifier of the inspector; used to implement toggling of the inspector when calling this method twice.\n          - 2nd argument: a callback function which can be used to render the secondary inspector. The callback function should return the secondary inspector content itself; or \"undefined/null\" to close the secondary inspector.\n\n          Example usage: props.renderSecondaryInspector('IMAGE_CROPPING', () => <MySecondaryInspectorContent />)\n\n    `));\n\n    inspector.add('saveHooks', new SynchronousRegistry(`\n        Sometimes, it is needed to run

identity of the new imageVariant must be stored inside the Value of the image.\n\n        The process is as follows:\n        - When an editor wants its value to be post-processed, it calls \\`props.commit(newValue, {hookName: hookOptions})\\`\n        - Then, when pressing Apply in the UI, the hookNames are resolved inside this \\`saveHooks\\` registry.\n\n        ## Hook Definitions\n\n        Every entry inside this registry is a function of the following signature:\n\n        (valueSoFar, hookOptions) => {\n            return new value,\n            can also return

      The actual *enabled* styles are determined by the NodeTypes configuration of the property.\n        This means, that if the node is configured using NodeTypes\n        \\`properties.[propertyName].ui.aloha.formatting.strong=true\\`, then the \"strong\" key inside this registry\n        is actually enabled for the editor.\n\n        For backwards compatibility reasons, the formatting-and-styling-registry *KEYS* must match the \"pre-React\"\n        UI, if they existed beforehand.\n\n\n        ## Configuration of CKeditor\n\n        With this config, CKeditor itself is controlled:\n        - the Advanced Content Filter (ACF) is configured, thus which markup is allowed in the editors\n        - which effect a button action actually has.\n\n        Currently, there exist three possible effects:\n        - *triggering a command*\n        - *setting a style*\n        - *executing arbitrary code*\n\n\n        ## Configuration Format:\n\n        NOTE: one of \"command\" or \"style\" must be specified in all cases.\n\n        - \\`command\\` (string, optional). If specified, this CKEditor command is triggered; so the command string\n          is known by CKeditor in the \"commands\" section:\n          http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/api/CKEDITOR.editor-method-getCommand\n\n        - \\`style\\` (object, optional). If specified, this CKEditor style is applied. Expects a style description\n          adhering to CKEDITOR.style(...), so for example: \\`{ style: {element: 'h1'}\\`\n\n        - \\`config\\` (function, optional): This function needs to adjust the CKEditor config to e.g. configure ACF\n          correctly. The function gets passed in the config so-far, and needs to return the modified config. See\n          \"CKEditor Configuration Helpers\" below for helper functions.\n\n        ## CKEditor Configuration Helpers\n\n        - \\`config: registry.ckEditor.formattingRules.config.addToFormatTags('h1')\\`: adds the passed-in tag to the\n          \\`format_tags\\` configuration option of CKEditor.\n\n        - \\`registry.ckEditor.formattingRules.config.add('Strong')\\`: adds the passed-in *Button Definition Name*\n          to the ACF configuration (automatic mode).
